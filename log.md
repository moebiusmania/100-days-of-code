# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 13: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Starting a small project in Hapi.

**Thoughts:** I'm building a simple backend in NodeJS and Hapi for the next lessons in the Javascript course, and it will be very much like that it will become a course itself!

### Day 12: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still learning Hapi.

**Thoughts:** Today's topic: views! I really wanted to have this thing available many years ago :D

### Day 11: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: New files for the React course.

**Thoughts:** Almost finished the classical "todo app" for the React course, this is the middle part of this basic course. I still think React is over-complicating easy tasks and this is another reason why I want to try out the Vue.js framework during the #100daysofcode.

### Day 10: January 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continuing on learning Hapi.

**Thoughts:** I'm continuing the egghead.io course, then I will continue with a Pluralsight one and an official tutorial I have forked today. It's really a fun framework!

### Day 9: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working on a new module for the React course.

**Thoughts:** It's a classic todo application, but since we have just got started, this is a nice example about interaction between different components. I'm planning to combine React and Hapi for the next module and a small lessone about NodeJS.

### Day 8: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Getting started with Hapi.js from official docs and online courses.

**Thoughts:** I really appreciate the ease of use of this framework, until now it seems very funny to use. Maybe I will dig a bit more on NodeJS development thanks to Hapi. I had also did my first deploy on [Zeit's Now](https://zeit.co/now)... very cool!

### Day 7: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Published the ```tumblr-feed```web component on NPM registry!

**Thoughts:** Unfortunately I wasn't been able to proceed on the challenge for a few days, but I have some other ideas for next ones!

**Link to work:** [tumblr-feed (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tumblr-feed)

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Forked an Atom package repo and continuing on the repo for the React course.

**Thoughts:** I want to dig a little bit into the Atom package development... too bad there is a lot of Coffeescript to handle with :( first attempt will be to adapt a simple one I wrote for Brackets years ago.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continuing on the repo for the React course.

**Thoughts:** Lots of improvements since the last time I had used React "seriously", but still prefer good'ol native Web Components :-) .

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setting up the repo for the first 3 lessons of a base React course.

**Thoughts:** Lots of boilerplate... but it seems now its sort of a standard regardless of the framework you choose.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: First attempt of deploying a Ghost installation on Heroku.

**Thoughts:** I'm in the process of developing a Ghost theme that uses its internal APIs for something that it isn't a blog, unfortunately I haven't been able to deploy it on Heroku with a Postgres DB but only with a SQLlite, so given Heroku functionality this will not be a way to permanently store data. I will figure out other ways in the coming days.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the demo page and actions for the `<tumblr-feed>` web component.

**Thoughts:** Still need to figure out how to publish with NPM with more than one account.

**Link to work:** [Tumblr Feed demo page](https://moebiusmania.github.io/tumblr-feed/)

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished and distributed a `<tumblr-feed>` web component built in SkateJS.

**Thoughts:** I have enjoyed building a web component in a different framwork, SkateJS is nice, still needs some improvements but in the overall is good. Tumblr JSON APIs are really ugly.
