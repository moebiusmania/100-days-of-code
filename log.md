# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Forked an Atom package repo and continuing on the repo for the React course.

**Thoughts:** I want to dig a little bit into the Atom package development... too bad there is a lot of Coffeescript to handle with :( first attempt will be to adapt a simple one I wrote for Brackets years ago.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continuing on the repo for the React course.

**Thoughts:** Lots of improvements since the last time I had used React "seriously", but still prefer good'ol native Web Components :-) .

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setting up the repo for the first 3 lessons of a base React course.

**Thoughts:** Lots of boilerplate... but it seems now its sort of a standard regardless of the framework you choose.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: First attempt of deploying a Ghost installation on Heroku.

**Thoughts:** I'm in the process of developing a Ghost theme that uses its internal APIs for something that it isn't a blog, unfortunately I haven't been able to deploy it on Heroku with a Postgres DB but only with a SQLlite, so given Heroku functionality this will not be a way to permanently store data. I will figure out other ways in the coming days.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the demo page and actions for the `<tumblr-feed>` web component.

**Thoughts:** Still need to figure out how to publish with NPM with more than one account.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished and distributed a `<tumblr-feed>` web component built in SkateJS.

**Thoughts:** I have enjoyed building a web component in a different framwork, SkateJS is nice, still needs some improvements but in the overall is good. Tumblr JSON APIs are really ugly.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
