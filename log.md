# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the demo page and actions for the `<tumblr-feed>` web component.

**Thoughts:** Still need to figure out how to publish with NPM with more than one account.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished and distributed a `<tumblr-feed>` web component built in SkateJS.

**Thoughts:** I have enjoyed building a web component in a different framwork, SkateJS is nice, still needs some improvements but in the overall is good. Tumblr JSON APIs are really ugly.

<!-- ### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
